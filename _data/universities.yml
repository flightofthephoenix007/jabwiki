  details: Students who do not comply by either showing that they have received the vaccines or indicating an exemption will have a “hold” placed on their record that will prevent registration for future classes. All records need to be received by Sept. 30, 2021, to prevent a registration hold from being placed on your account that prevents registration for the Spring 2022 semester. Subsequent completion of the requirement with the vaccine or an exemption will remove the hold.
